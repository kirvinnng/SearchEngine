Go has its own elegance and programming idioms that make the language productive and fun to code in. The language designers set out to create a language that

constructs they needed. This balance is achieved through a minimized set of keywords, built-in functions, and syntax. Go also provides a comprehensive standard
library. The standard library provides all the core packages programmers need to
build real-world web- and network-based programs. 
To see this in action, we will review a complete Go program that implements functionality 
that can be found in many Go programs being developed today. The program pulls different data feeds from the 
web and compares the content against a
