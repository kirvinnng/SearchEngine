is chapter will guide you through the process of setting up your Go 
development environment and introduce you to the language is syntax. People 
have written entire books on the fundamental mechanics of the language; this 
chapter covers the most basic concepts you will need in order to work through 
the code examples in the following chapters. We will cover everything from 
primitive data types to implementing concurrency. For readers who are 
already well versed in the language, you will find much of this chapter to be a 
review.
SETTING UP A DEVELOPMENT 
ENVIRONMENT
To get started with Go, you will need a functional development environment. In 
this section, we will walk you through the steps to download Go and set up 
your workspace and environment variables. We will discuss various options for 
your integrated development environment and some of the standard tooling 
that comes with Go.
Downloading and Installing Go
Start by downloading the Go binary release most appropriate to your 
operating system and architecture from. Binaries exist 
for Windows, Linux, and macOS. If you are using a system that does not have 
an available precompiled binary, you can download the Go source code from 
that link.
Execute the binary and follow the prompts, which will be minimal, in order 
to install the entire set of Go core packages. Packages, called librariesin 
most other languages, contain useful code you can use in your Go programs.
